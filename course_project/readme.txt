(advanced)


#1. Make a new Django project and app
#2. Have the root route render the main wireframe above
#3. Create the POST method to add new courses to the database
#4. Ensure that the name entered is more than 5 characters, and 
the description is more than 15 characters
Display all the courses in a table beneath the form
For each course, have a link to remove that renders a 
page as shown in the second wireframe
If the user selects "No," redirect to the root route.
If the user selects "Yes," delete the course and redirect 
to the root route  NINJA BONUS: Make the description a 
separate class and have the description field of the
Course class be a one-to-one relationship with Description

renders a page with a form to make comments and a list of 
all comments for that course

prompting with a modal and processing the remove 
accordingly (No--close the modal without deleting,
